# Simple-Examples-Keras

## Description

Simple examples based on Keras (a library of TensorFlow).

## Tutorial

Keras is an API running on top of TensorFlow, which greatly simplifies the construction and application of artifitial neural networks. The documentation of Keras can be seen [here](https://keras.io/). 

I uploaded some simple examples of Keras in this repository. All parameters are listed in the beginning of each file, which can changed easily.

Enjoy your time with Keras and Python! Suggestions and more examples (as well as STARs) are welcomed.
